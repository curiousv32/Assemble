# Summary Sentence:
Assemble is a one-stop mobile application that helps post-secondary students manage their study and life tasks by integrating note-taking, study tools, and to-do lists for optimal ease of use in academics.

# Project Description:
Assemble is designed to assist students in managing the complexities of university life, including note-taking, assignments, and general tasks. Our primary objective as programmers is to streamline the use of multiple tools into a single, efficient solution. This will help students save time and focus on what matters most: staying on top of their courses and succeeding academically.
The application targets post-secondary students, who can benefit the most from efficient note-taking, productive study habits, and a robust to-do list for tracking deadlines. However, Assemble can also be useful for others not currently in formal education to organize their life using our to-do list feature or the timer feature, but the main target audience for our app are students.
Currently, students use various separate applications to maintain their notes, calendars, and flashcards, leading to a fragmented and inconsistent study process. Not only does it lead to these issues, it also causes an overload of information in learning different user interfaces and  knowing each applicationâ€™s capabilities. Assemble aims to resolve this by seamlessly integrating all these key components into one platform. This integration will promote more productive studying and ensure students never miss a deadline.

# Market Value:
Furthermore, Assemble addresses this problem by consolidating task management and information organization into a single unified interface, enhancing learning efficiency and time management. By integrating these features, Assemble not only reduces the cognitive load associated with juggling multiple tools but also provides a cohesive and streamlined user experience. This allows students to focus more on learning and less on administrative tasks, ultimately improving their academic performance and reducing stress in the long run.

# How It Would Work:
Assemble will be a mobile application integrating note-taking, study tools, and a to-do list. The note-taking feature will allow users to create, edit, organize, and search notes efficiently, categorizing them by subjects and topics. The study tool will include a flashcard system for self-testing and a pomodoro timer to enhance focus and productivity. Users can set timers for study sessions and breaks to avoid burnout. The to-do list will feature a calendar for tracking assignments, exams, and deadlines, with notifications and reminders to ensure tasks are completed on time. Integration between the to-do list and note-taking features will link notes directly to tasks, providing a comprehensive view of study materials and deadlines. Assemble will offer a user-friendly interface, customizable notes, and advanced tools to optimize study patterns, productivity, and overall progress, making it an indispensable tool for academic success.

# Success Criteria:
The success of Assemble will be measured by the following criteria: Firstly, at least 80% of users should report improved efficiency and quality of their notes after using the note-taking tool. Secondly, at least 80% of students should report that the integrated study tool with flashcards has enhanced their revision process. Finally, users should be able to complete 90% of their study tasks by the deadline because of the timer & to-do list feature.
