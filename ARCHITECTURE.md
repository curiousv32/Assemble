# Assemble Architecture

This document describes the overall architecture of the Assemble application, a mobile app designed to help students manage their studies.

## Packages and Source Files

The main source code for the Assemble application resides within the following packages located in the `app` directory:

* **activity:** This package contains the core activities of the application. Activities represent single screens with lifecycles that handle user interactions.
* **model:** This package contains the data models used by the application. These models define the underlying data structures for the information the app manages.
* **util:** This package contains utility classes with general-purpose functions reusable across the application.

**Here's a breakdown of the functionalities within these packages:**

**activity Package:**

    * `HomePageActivity.java`: Entry point of the application after successful login or launch. This activity displays the initial screen and presents essential options or features to the user. It might also handle user interactions to navigate to other activities within the application (depending on the overall design).
    * `LoginPageActivity.java`: Manages the user login process. It likely includes UI elements for entering login credentials, handling authentication logic, and displaying error or success messages based on the login attempt. Optionally, it might provide functionality for password recovery or account creation.
    * `SignUpActivity.java`: Handles user registration or account creation. It likely presents UI elements for entering user information, handling user registration logic, and displaying error or success messages based on the registration attempt. It might also provide options for selecting user preferences or account settings.

**Model Package:**

The `model` package in Assemble contains classes that represent the data structures used by the application. These data structures define the underlying information the app manages. In this case, the model package contains classes for entities relevant to the Assemble application's functionalities, such as users, notes, flashcards, and other tasks.

   * `User.java`: The `User.java` file defines a `User` class, which acts as a data model for user information within the Assemble application. This class encapsulates the essential properties of a user:

        * **id:** This property represents a unique identifier for each user within the system (e.g., an ID generated by a database or backend server).
        * **username:** This property stores the username chosen by the user for login purposes.
        * **password:** This property holds the user's password, stored securely using encryption or hashing techniques.


**util Package:**

The `util` package in Assemble contains utility classes that provide general-purpose functions reusable across the application. These functions encapsulate functionalities not specific to any particular activity or data model.

  * `SharedPreferencesManager.java`: The `SharedPreferencesManager.java` file defines a `SharedPreferencesManager` class. This class facilitates storing and retrieving user information using the Android SharedPreferences API.

## System Architecture

**Explanation of the Architecture:**

The Assemble application follows a layered architecture with the following components:

1. **User Interface (Activities):** This layer represents the various screens of the application, such as the home page, login page, note creation activity, etc. These activities handle user interactions (taps, swipes, etc.) and display information to the user.
2. **User Interaction:** This layer represents the user's actions within the application. This includes entering data, navigating between screens, and triggering various functionalities.
3. **Data Model (model package):** This layer represents the data structures used by the application. These data models define the underlying information the app manages, such as user information, notes, flashcards, and tasks.
4. **Data Persistence (Optional):** This layer is optional and depends on the implementation. Data can be persisted locally using the Android SharedPreferences API (implemented by `SharedPreferencesManager.java`) or on a remote server for more robust data storage.
5. **Utility Functions (util package):** This layer provides general-purpose functions that can be used by any activity or data model. These functions encapsulate functionalities like formatting dates, displaying notifications.

**Data Flow:**

- User interactions from the User Interface layer trigger actions within the activities.
- Activities might interact with the Data Model layer to retrieve or update data objects (e.g., user information, notes).
- Data might be persisted locally using SharedPreferences or stored on a remote server (if implemented).
- Utility functions from the `util` package can be used by any layer to perform specific tasks.

**Benefits of this Architecture:**

- Improved separation of concerns: This architecture separates the user interface, data, and business logic, leading to a more maintainable and testable codebase.
- Reusability
